#Simon Arduino mini-game

This is the source code for an Arduino project I did for my OOP class during university.

For those unfamiliar, "Simon" it's a memory game that consists of a display with 4 coloured lights which turn on in a random sequence and the player has to insert the corect order of the sequence which was displayed.

Sheet of the circuit coming soon.

Feel free to use the code for your projects :D
